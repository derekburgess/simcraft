Huge refactor using `Claude Code Opus 4.6`
The "Ring" concept has been changed to a dynamic manifold barrier that is manipulated by gravity and gravitational events.
Many other little improvements and bug fixes. Improved RNG and now output number on quit.

As the project has grown and AI models have become more capable, agentic IDE's more user friendly, this project has shifted to function as a sort of test. Models that have contributed: `Github Copilot/GPT-3`, `GPT-4`, `GPT-4o`, `GPT-4o-mini`, `Claude 3.5 Sonnet`, `Claude 3.7 Sonnet`, `Gemini 2.5 Pro`, `Grok-2`

Added a RNG for fun...
