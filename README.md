A pixel universe simulators written with OpenAI GPT4 and VSCode Copilot. Uses `Python` and `pygame`.

```pip install pygame```

```clock.py``` -- This crazy "clock" based universe simulator, our "great attractor" moves like the old school clocks in a continous minute. This runs like shit after a few minutes, but I ran it for 90 minutes and had some interesting "galaxy clusters" form. In the end, this program was not what I was originally going for but evolved in a fun way and results in fun simulations, forcing you to ponder time and scale. I couldnt get the AI's to reason through concurrency or other performance improvements. Something I will learn and implement myself.

```sim.py``` -- This was my original plan. A set and forget universe simulator with my "great attractor" ring. Why? I had this drunk thought along the lines of "what if the 'great attractor' was actually just gravity on the edge of expanding manifold?" and so I wanted to see if I could make this simulation using OpenAI, because that's been my thing lately lol... anyways- run it and find out.
